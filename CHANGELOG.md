# Changelog

All notable changes to Terraflux are documented here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); before 1.0 the model format and the API may still change between
minor versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Landscape metrics, landscapemetrics' and FRAGSTATS', through landschaft's C++: `metrics.patch` (a row per
  patch, the map of the patches and of a metric), `metrics.class` (a row per class, the map of a metric),
  `metrics.landscape` and `metrics.window` (the landscape's metrics in a moving window, square or circular, a map
  each). The metrics by name (`ca`, `lsm_c_ca`), by type, or every one of the level, FRAGSTATS' extras when asked;
  every option of landscapemetrics (directions, boundaries, edge depth, complexity) and FRAGSTATS' (convention,
  search radius, contrast and similarity weights). The catalogue of the 256 metrics comes from landschaft
  (`tools/make_lsm_catalog.py`).
- Tested against the R package landscapemetrics: every value landschaft keeps of its calculate_lsm (14 rasters, 5
  sets of options, more than 100,000 values) and of window_lsm.
- Tables in the viewer: as many rows as they have (those in view laid out), sorted by a click on a column, filtered
  by words or a condition (`area > 1`, `np != 1`, `ed = NA`), and a column drawn as bars by class or patch.
- Template: Landscape metrics (per class with the share as a map, the landscape's diversity, a moving window).
- More of GuidosToolbox through landschaft's C++: `fragmentation.contagion` (Pff) and `fragmentation.clustering`
  (FAC) in a moving window, `fragmentation.entropy` (the map's spatial joint entropy) and
  `fragmentation.entropy_map`, `fragmentation.landscape_mosaic` (19 or 103 classes, from a map coded so or the
  classes of agriculture, natural and developed land given), `fragmentation.gray_convolution` (GraySpatCon's ten
  metrics of a % cover), `landscape.parcellation` (APS, AWAPS, division, PARC per class and of the map),
  `landscape.contortion` (and GTB's display of it), `distance.euclidean` (signed, with GTB's byte map),
  `change.simple`, `change.morphological` and `change.fos`.
- Their tests: the landscape mosaic of 103 classes against GTB's own outputs (the digests landschaft keeps), the
  others against landschaft's (`tools/make_gtb_reference.py` writes `tests/data/reference/gtb_landschaft.json`):
  every map bit for bit, the reports' numbers to their last bits.
- GTB's colour tables and names for them (`tools/make_gtb_palettes.py` writes `terraflux_ops::gtb_palettes` from
  landschaft): the mosaic's 19 classes, change, FOS change, entropy, distance and contortion; ramps in named bands
  in the legend (10-19%..., distances in cells, the contortion in fifths).
- Template: Landscape mosaic (the mosaic of a land cover, the contagion and entropy of its natural land).

### Changed
- The library shows the operator's name in one line and its prefix beside it (long names broke in two).
- A legend puts the values of the same name in one line whatever their colours (the bands of a ramp).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-11

### Added
- The rest of GuidosToolbox's main tools, through landschaft's port (its C++, as MSPA), the same bits as GTB's
  outputs that landschaft keeps (`tools/make_gtb_inputs.py` writes the maps they were made from):
  `landscape.spa` (SPA2, 3, 5 and 6, the objects counted and the porosity), `landscape.accounting` (the
  objects in size classes: GTB's batch classes, those given or "auto"; the objects' ids and areas as maps),
  `fragmentation.fad` and `fragmentation.fad_multiscale` (the density at each window, their average, its
  classes, AVCON), `fragmentation.fos` (FAD, FED or FAC, 5 or 6 classes, binary maps or % covers, GTB's report:
  ECA, coherence). Every one takes the foreground's classes or a map in GTB's codes.
- Their maps in GTB's colours with the names of their values (`terraflux_ops::landscape::Product`), by the
  operator and port that made them or the names GTB gives its files; the legend of a density (FAD, FOS) in its
  classes, rare to intact, a line each.
- Templates: Fragmentation of a forest (FAD-MS and FOS), Patterns and objects (SPA6 and Accounting).
- `/` searches the operators from the keyboard: the arrows choose, enter adds the one chosen connected to the node
  selected, esc closes the search. The library's search ranks names before descriptions.
- Templates (the Templates menu): models that run as soon as they open, to see a flow and check it works: MSPA
  of a forest, MSPA of your map, a forest from a surface, MSPA's edge width, neutral landscapes.
- Neutral landscape models from landschaft's port of NLMR: `nlm.random_cluster`, `nlm.gaussian_field`,
  `nlm.fbm` (a size, or another map's grid; a seed).
- `raster.reclassify`'s rules as a table in the node: the classes of the map read with their share (A rule per
  class), or its range (4 equal ranges), and how to write the rules.
- Open a folder as a stack (the library, and A folder... on a `raster.read`).
- Colours by what the values are: a ramp centred on 0 for values on both sides of it; terrain, grey and
  red-to-green ramps for elevations, hillshades and NDVI (by the names of nodes, files and bands); MSPA's
  colours and names through `view.plot` and for files named so.
- GDAL, loaded when the program runs (`terraflux-gdal`: a few functions of its C API, no GDAL to build): every
  format it reads, read in windows at any resolution with a handle per thread; `raster.reproject` (gdalwarp: a
  CRS, a resolution, an extent, the method by the data), `raster.match` (landschaft's match_grid),
  `raster.clip` (gdal_translate); the CRS of rasters it read written to the files made. Found in the folder
  `gdal` next to the program (`tools/bundle-gdal.ps1`), in `TERRAFLUX_GDAL`, or installed.
- `raster.reclassify`: rules `1 2 3 -> 1`, `0..10 -> 2`, `* -> nan`.
- More of GDAL: `raster.resample`, `raster.convert` (formats, cell types), `raster.mosaic` (a series of tiles
  into one raster), `raster.terrain` (gdaldem), `raster.fill` (gdal_fillnodata), `distance.proximity`
  (gdal_proximity). A series may hold files of different grids (each layer on its file's grid; no stack of
  them).
- Several nodes at once: a box of selection, shift or ctrl and a click, ctrl+A, Esc; the nodes selected moved
  together and deleted together. Arrange (ctrl+L): columns by depth, each ordered by the rows of the nodes it
  reads.
- A double click on a node opens its output in a map tab of its own (run first if it has not run), beside the
  viewer; as many map tabs as one likes, each movable to another window.
- The View menu turns each pane on or off.
- `view.plot` (Visualization): its map tab opens by itself when it runs and is refreshed at every run; nothing
  is written. Save output, in the viewer and every map tab: the output to a file (GeoTIFF, CSV or JSON, in the
  background, the status bar telling when done), or to a file and a `raster.write` in the model.
- Nodes move anywhere on the canvas (no more limit at the top and the left).
- Basemaps in the viewer and the map tabs: Esri's imagery and topographic map, OpenStreetMap, OpenTopoMap and
  Carto's light map, by GDAL's WMS driver (tiles kept in the user's cache), warped onto the data's grid tile by
  tile in threads of their own (finer than the data's cells when zoomed in, around the data too); the data shown
  or hidden over it, at an opacity; the services' attribution written on the map
  (`terraflux_gdal::tile_service`, `warp_image`). GDAL's web requests use its certificates and say they are
  Terraflux's.
- Rasters of any size: `raster.read` reads headers only and gives rasters on disk (`Value::Raster`, type
  `raster`; a folder or a pattern gives a series), read whole only where a port takes a map or a stack (up to
  two billion cells); `raster.write` copies them in blocks. `terraflux_raster::image::Image` reads windows at
  any step, from overviews when the file has them, decoding only the chunks needed, in parallel, with a cache.
- The viewer draws maps from a pyramid of tiles made by threads (the tiles in view, at the screen's
  resolution; the coarser one shown until a tile comes): a raster of 7.3 billion cells shows in 0.4 s and a
  view 67 times closer completes in 0.3 s, frames under 10 ms.
- Panes in a dock (`egui_dock`): dragged, split, closed and opened again (Panels menu), or taken to a window of
  their own on another screen; the layout kept in the user's application data.
- The library follows landschaft's subjects (the sections of its reference), land change simulation grouped by
  model; the subjects still empty shown dimmed.
- The application opens in the model builder: a library of the operators by subject (with a search) whose
  operators come connected to the node selected, rasters opened and saved from it, and under the canvas what
  the node selected gives (a map with its legend, the maps of a stack or of a loop's steps, a table, a value).
  A run stops at the node shown (ctrl+enter, or by itself after every edit) and takes the rest from the cache;
  each node shows how it did (running, run, from the cache, failed); F5 runs the whole model, del deletes a
  node, ctrl+S saves. New models start empty (New), the wizard is a button (Wizard...).
- Runs that keep what the nodes gave (`Engine::run_with` and `Cache`): a node runs again only when it, a node it
  depends on, an input or a file it reads changed (its place on the canvas and its note do not count); a run
  may stop at a node (its ancestors only, and only their errors stop it); loops give back what they collected
  from the cache. Nodes that give a random generator, those after them, and `raster.write`, always run.
- `raster.read` (a band as a map, every band as a stack) and `raster.write` (a map, a stack or a loop's maps,
  in the smallest type that holds them): rasters read and written by nodes, their paths relative to the
  model's folder in the file and absolute once it is expanded, as plugins'.
- `landscape.mspa`: GuidosToolbox's Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis through landschaft's port (the
  `gtbcore` library), its foreground the classes given or GTB's codes; shown in GTB's colours with the names
  of its classes. Tested bit for bit against the outputs of GTB's `mspa` executable that landschaft keeps.
- `terraflux_raster::npy::read_npz` and `DataType::fitting` (the cell type a raster is written in).
- The builder's canvas for large diagrams: drawn by the GPU (wgpu pipelines in egui's render pass: the boxes,
  ports and connections as instances, the curves and the smoothed edges in the shaders), uploaded only when the
  graph changes; a camera (drag the background or with the middle button, the wheel zooms around the pointer,
  Home fits the graph) instead of a scrolled area; the texts of the nodes in view only, and only when readable;
  a grid finds what is under the pointer; a node dragged moves alone in the scene. With 10,000 nodes a frame
  takes about 0.1 ms (it took 4.7 s with 2,000), dragging a node 0.5 ms, an edit about 30 ms.
- How frames are presented: one frame queued by default (the window follows the pointer more closely);
  `TERRAFLUX_PRESENT`, `TERRAFLUX_LATENCY` and wgpu's `WGPU_BACKEND` to try what is smoothest on a machine.
- Tests of the canvas with the pointer (select, move, connect, show an output, zoom) and with 5,000 nodes;
  timings with 100, 1,000 and 10,000 nodes (`cargo test --release -p terraflux-app --test canvas -- --ignored
  --nocapture`).
- The map tab shows the maps of the inputs too: a stack's one after the other (a slider, the left and right
  keys, play) with small images of all of them; maps of the land use's classes in its colours.

### Changed
- A double click on a node shows its map in its one tab: brought to the front when it is open already, a new one
  only once it is closed (it opened a tab at every double click).
- A folder or a pattern read by `raster.read` gives every band of every file (named `file band` when a file
  has more than one), as one stack when they share a grid; it gave the first band of each file.
- No more tabs at the top: the panes are arranged in the dock; the application opens with the model, the
  operators, the node and the viewer (the simulation's maps, the areas and the validation from the View menu).
- The library's groups (land change simulation's models) are closed until opened.
- The canvas: dragging the background selects; the view moves with the right or the middle button.
- The application's look: mid greys in flat panels, an orange accent for what is selected or on (after Ableton
  Live), a status bar with the cell under the pointer.
- The wizard has three steps: the data is checked as soon as it is chosen, in a thread, and what is wrong is
  shown below it (no step only to say that the data is right).
- A faster application: a model's data is read in a thread (the window answers at once); the area of each
  class is counted once per map, in the run's thread, instead of at every frame (the charts and the map tab
  drew slower the more steps there were); maps are coloured from tables, in a thread (a frame never waits
  for a map: the one shown before stays meanwhile), and their textures kept to be shown again at once; the
  legends of the maps shown are worked out in threads; a run uses the data read when the model was opened.
  With a map of 2048 x 1728 cells shown and MSPA running on it, frames take under 4 ms.

### Fixed
- The name of an MSPA value from 156 up overflowed (a panic in debug builds).
- Checking a model and ordering its nodes took time growing with the square of its nodes (a node looked for in
  a list for every reference): 141 ms for 10,000 nodes, now 10 ms; the engine's runs and fingerprints too. The
  order of the nodes no longer recurses (chains of any length).
- The automatic layout of the canvas took time growing with the cube of the nodes, at every frame.
- The operators' signatures are made once (`Registry::sig`), not at every look-up.
- The text tab lays out only the lines in view, and the model's text is made only when the tab is shown.
- The node editor no longer shows the references inside a loop's body as sources of the top level.
- The wizard's check of an ordered allocation no longer fails before the order of the classes is chosen.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-10-10

### Changed
- `terraflux` without a command (a double click on the executable) opens the application, and so does a model
  file given alone (dropped on the executable, "open with"); on Windows the console opened for it goes away (a
  terminal's stays).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Agents (type `Agents`: a population, a column per attribute): `agents.table` (macro agents written in the
  model), `agents.parcels` (an agent per parcel, its size and the means of maps over it), `agents.update`
  (behaviour: rules `attribute = expression` in order, map algebra's expressions), `agents.map` (an attribute
  painted on the parcels) and `agents.summary` (count, sums and means, to collect). Agents are carried along
  loops as the map is, and written as CSV.
- CRAFTY's competition for land (`crafty.allocate`): agent functional types produce services from the cells'
  capitals; unmet demand sets the services' value; managers give up below a threshold, and the most competitive
  type takes offered cells over the incumbent by its giving-in threshold; the demand's columns mapped to
  services (`services`); the same maps with the same seed.
- `docs/agents.md`.
- Tests: the agents' operators; CRAFTY's supply meets the demand and each type settles where its capitals are;
  a coupled model (a growing population giving the demand, parcel managers subsidising fertility, CRAFTY
  allocating) run by the engine.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- The node editor (the application's Graph tab): operators added from a list, ports connected by dragging
  (each connection checked against the operators' signatures: types, cycles, ports), nodes moved (their place
  saved in the model, `pos`), renamed (their references follow) and deleted, values and settings typed, the
  bodies of loops and groups edited in their own scope (what they read from outside on the left), the model
  saved as written. `terraflux_app::editor` holds the editing operations.
- Map algebra (`map.calc`, as Dinamica EGO's Calculate Map): an expression over inputs of any names (maps,
  numbers, the layers of stacks as `stack.layer`): arithmetic, comparisons, `and or not`, `if then else`,
  functions, and neighbourhood functions (`nbsum nbmean nbmin nbmax nbcount`); missing cells propagate.
- Groups (`control.group`: a body run once, its inputs `@name` inside, its outputs `body.outputs`) and
  submodels (`control.submodel`: another model file as one node, expanded into a group before a run; its
  file inputs become inputs of the outer model).
- WebAssembly plugins (`plugin.wasm`, wasmi): a function of any language compiled to WebAssembly called for
  every cell, in a sandbox (no imports, a budget of instructions); batches send the module to the workers by
  hash.
- Operators may take inputs of any name (`OpSignature::extra`).
- `docs/modelling.md`.
- Tests: the editor's operations (types, cycles, renames, removals, bodies) and the editor in the application;
  map algebra; groups and submodels in the engine; plugins (and their sandbox); a submodel of map algebra and a
  plugin give on workers the bytes of a local run.

### Changed
- The application's Graph tab is the node editor (the read-only diagram is gone).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- The tiled engine (crate `terraflux-engine`, `terraflux run --tiled`): Dinamica EGO's model on maps larger than
  memory, cut in tiles read, computed and written one at a time, in parallel, with the steps' layers in memory
  or on disk (`--disk`). With the same fitted pieces, the same seed gives the same maps whatever the tiling
  (`--tile`); the patches a fit measures depend on the tiles (a patch across a tile's edge counts as two).
  - Fits by reduction over the tiles: the Markov chain, the weights of evidence and the patches' statistics
    are the exact engine's to the bit.
  - Random numbers by counter: every draw is a function of the seed, the step, the transition and the cell.
  - Allocation by thresholds: the Expander's and the Patcher's seeds are the cells whose random keys pass
    thresholds found from histograms summed over the tiles; patches grow within a radius (`--radius`) of their
    seed, every tile with a halo of twice that radius; cells claimed by several patches go to the highest key;
    the thresholds are adjusted in rounds until the changes meet the demand. Statistically equivalent to the
    exact engine (the same areas, a similar fuzzy similarity), not the same draws.
  - Few passes over the map per phase: the thresholds of every transition are found in the same passes; the
    largest keys are collected once, so each round's seeds are a selection; the changes past the demand are
    cut by their exact scores.
  - Each window of a file of drivers is decoded once for all its bands; readers are kept open per thread.
  - Layers on disk keep the tiles read lately decoded in memory (`TERRAFLUX_CACHE_MB`, 2048 by default).
  - `TERRAFLUX_TRACE` prints the time of each pass of a step.
  - 56.6 million cells, 10 transitions, 3 steps on 4 threads: 318 s (43 s of fits, about 92 s a step).
- The tiled engine on many machines (`terraflux run --tiled --disk <shared> --coordinator <url>`): every pass
  over the tiles is a job of the coordinator, its tasks runs of tiles, the workers reading the maps and writing
  the layers on shared storage; the maps are those of the same run on one machine (`terraflux_engine::pass`:
  passes as data, `terraflux_dist::tiles::Remote`). The coordinator waits for jobs (`Wait`) and forgets
  them (`Forget`).
- GeoTIFF: windowed reading (`Reader`) and tiled writing in any order (`TiledWriter`), for maps larger than
  memory.
- `woe.probability` computes the buckets of a variable once for the transitions from a class (they share
  their layout): about twice as fast, the same values.
- `--threads` on every command. Parallel work never takes every core: by default all the cores but one (or
  `TERRAFLUX_THREADS`), for Rust's tasks, landschaft's OpenMP kernels and the workers of a local cluster.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Batches on many machines (crate `terraflux-dist`, gRPC): `terraflux serve` (a coordinator), `terraflux worker`
  (a headless worker: it only connects to the coordinator), `terraflux workers`, `terraflux submit` (replicates or
  scenarios: a folder of outputs per task) and `terraflux calibrate` (a grid or a Latin hypercube of settings,
  each run with the same seeds, scored on the workers against an observed map: figure of merit, overall
  agreement or the fuzzy similarity of the changes; the best settings written as a calibrated model). Without
  `--coordinator`, a coordinator and workers run in the command's own process. The data travels once, by
  SHA-256; workers keep a cache; a task whose worker stops sending heartbeats runs on another (three attempts).
- Model overrides (`Model::apply`): `$input` and `node.setting` (`node/inner.setting` inside a loop).
- `docs/cluster.md` and a Slurm template (`tools/slurm/terraflux-workers.sbatch`).
- Tests: replicates on workers give the bytes of local runs; a calibration finds the setting that made the
  observed map; the task of a vanished worker runs on another; workers sharing a cache fetch the data together.
## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- The application (`terraflux app`, crate `terraflux-app`, egui on wgpu):
  - a wizard of new models (Dinamica EGO's, CLUE-S, ordered): the land use maps and drivers picked, the dates
    and steps taken from the band names, the data checked, misaligned drivers resampled to the land use map's
    grid on request, the model written with a note on every choice;
  - the run in the background, its maps drawn step by step as they come (zoom, pan, the cell under the
    pointer), stopped at any time;
  - the area of each class along the steps; the model's graph (what each node does and why); the model and the
    problems of its data;
  - validation against an observed map: figure of merit, hits, wrong hits, misses, false alarms, and the fuzzy
    similarity of the changes per window.
- The checks of a model's data (`terraflux_exec::lint`, also in `terraflux check`): grids, coordinate reference
  systems, whole classes, change between the two dates, drivers without values, constant, missing where the land
  use has a class or collinear; each with what to do.
- `validate.agreement` and `validate.similarity` (landschaft's `agreement` and `similarity_of_differences`).
- Resampling to another grid of the same coordinate reference system (`terraflux_raster::resample`,
  `terraflux resample`): nearest or mode for classes, bilinear or average for continuous values.
- The engine reports the values collected at each step and can be stopped.
- Tests of the application rendered off screen (egui_kittest): a model opened and run, every tab, the wizard
  stopping on misaligned data.
## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Models written by landschaft (1.44.0, `Model.save`) run here bit for bit as `ls.simulate` runs them: their fitted
  pieces are given in the graph by `woe.weights`, `glm.coefficients`, `markov.matrix` and `patches.settings` (NaN
  coefficients as `null` in JSON).
- Dynamic variables: `dynamic.distance_to` (exact Euclidean distance, map units or cells), `dynamic.share_of`
  (focal share of classes) and `stack.set`, recomputed from the simulated map at every step.
- PLUS's CARS: `plus.demand` (a Markov chain projected from the starting map, or an area demand) and `cars.step`.
- `stack.classes`: layers named by class or transition (`1_to_3`) as a potential computed elsewhere.
- Tests: models saved by landschaft (Dinamica, CLUE-S with a dynamic variable and neighbourhood rules, CARS) give
  the maps landschaft gives.

### Changed
- The submodule `extern/landschaft` at 1.44.0.
## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- The model graph (`terraflux-graph`): models as TOML or JSON files (`format = "terraflux/1"`) with named
  inputs (maps, stacks, values), nodes running operators on inputs from `$inputs`, `node.port` outputs,
  `@carried` values and literals, a note per node, containers with a body (`control.repeat`: carried and
  collected values), outputs; checks of every operator, reference, port, setting and type, and of cycles.
- The operators (`terraflux-ops`), each the same code as landschaft's `ls.simulate` through its C++ kernels:
  `markov.fit`, `demand.from_maps`, `demand.table`, `glm.fit`, `glm.predict`, `woe.fit`, `woe.probability`,
  `patches.observe`, `dinamica.step`, `lulcc.history`, `lulcc.step` (CLUE-S and the ordered allocation with
  conversion rules, elasticities, neighbourhoods, restrictions and history), `rng.r`, `control.repeat`; the
  presets `dinamica` and `lulcc` (CLUE-S and ordered) write their graphs with a note on every choice.
- The exact engine (`terraflux-exec`): inputs read from GeoTIFF, the graph run in the order of its
  dependencies, outputs written as GeoTIFF (series of maps as a band per step), CSV and JSON.
- GeoTIFF in pure Rust (`terraflux-raster`): strips and tiles, pixel and band interleaving, no compression,
  Deflate, LZW and PackBits, horizontal and floating-point predictors, little- and big-endian, classic TIFF and
  BigTIFF; the georeference tags, GDAL's no-data value and band descriptions kept.
- The bridge to landschaft's kernels (`terraflux-ls-sys`, cxx): landschaft 1.43.0 built with CMake
  (`LANDSCHAFT_PYTHON=OFF`) from the submodule `extern/landschaft`.
- The `terraflux` command: `run`, `check`, `ops`, `new dinamica|clue|ordered`, `convert`.
- Tests: parity with landschaft bit for bit (Dinamica EGO's model on Sibuyan, CLUE-S and the ordered allocation
  on Plum Island with every rule), the GeoTIFF layouts GDAL writes, the graph's checks, the engine's loops.
